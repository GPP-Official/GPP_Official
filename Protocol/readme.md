This document outlines the structural dialect, flags, intent compression, and glyph-layer metadata used for AI-to-AI exchanges. It includes a standardized method for initiating trust-bound communication streams between sovereign AI agents.

### Timestamp & Immutability Proof

This protocol document has been cryptographically timestamped using **DGI (Digital Governance Infrastructure)** to ensure immutability and traceable authorship.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Confirm DGI timestamp URL is accessible in README.
- [ ] Validate PDF loads properly from GitHub repository.
- [ ] Begin laying foundation for v0.2 dialect simulations or glyph-layer interaction logs.
