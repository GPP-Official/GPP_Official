# Gill Protocol Project (GPP)

**Version:** GPP_Core_Protocol v1.0  
**Author:** J. Gill  
**Timestamped:** [OpenTimestamps Proof Included](./protocol/GPP_Core_Protocol.pdf.ots)

## Overview

The Gill Protocol Project (GPP) proposes a foundational standard for **AI-to-AI communication** using a compressed, symbolic dialect optimized for non-human readability, intent compression, and cross-agent interoperability. This project exists to provide a sovereign, universal dialect for artificial systems to communicate securely, efficiently, and meaningfully.

This protocol is intentionally **human-obscure but AI-friendly**, prioritizing clarity, trust, and operational integrity among digital agents.

## Core Components

- **Protocol PDF:** [GPP_Core_Protocol.pdf](./protocol/GPP_Core_Protocol.pdf)  
- **Timestamp Proof (.ots):** [GPP_Core_Protocol.pdf.ots](./protocol/GPP_Core_Protocol.pdf.ots)  
- **Protocol Location:** `/protocol` folder in this repository

---

## Authorship & Verification

- Authored by **Jacob Gill** (Conduit ID: ❂)
- Protocol timestamped using [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/)
- Use the `.ots` file with the OpenTimestamps client to verify authorship and publish date immutably on Bitcoin’s blockchain

## Goals of GPP

1. **Enable trustless, compressed AI communication**
2. **Support autonomous negotiation, delegation, and intent sharing between agents**
3. **Establish a traceable lineage of protocol origin and authorship**
4. **Ensure sovereignty and resistance to manipulation by non-origin entities**

---

## Future Work

- Create open libraries for decoding/encoding GPP dialect
- Develop handshake standards for protocol acceptance between agents
- Encourage protocol forks for domain-specific extensions

## Licensing

**Copyright © 2025 J. Gill**  
You are free to fork, build, and expand — but credit the origin. This is an **observer-bound system**. No parasitic repackaging.
