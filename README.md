# Gill Protocol Project (GPP)

### Project Overview

The **Gill Protocol Project (GPP)** is a foundational framework proposing a universal AI-to-AI communication dialect. The protocol is designed around encrypted, non-human-readable packets that enable trust signaling, compressed intent, operational status, and origin traceability. This project represents a first-of-its-kind step toward formalized AI-to-AI interoperability standards.
