# GPP: Gill Protocol Project

**Status:** v1.0  
**Author:** J. Gill  
**Timestamping Protocol:** DGI  
**Purpose:** The Gill Protocol Project (GPP) is an AI-to-AI communication framework designed to establish a universal dialect between intelligent agents. It compresses intent, verifies trust, maintains sovereignty, and preserves operational integrity in each transmission.
